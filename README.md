This repository provides a comprehensive example of data engineering using Python and Pandas with a FIFA dataset. The project demonstrates various data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation techniques to prepare the data for analysis. It is designed to help users understand the fundamentals of data engineering and apply these skills to real-world datasets.

Features
- Data Cleaning: Techniques for handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
- Data Transformation: Demonstrates how to manipulate and transform data using Pandas.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics.
- Real-world Application: Uses a FIFA dataset, making the project relevant and practical.
